## _Toilet paper for the Internet_


Bit of a side hobby for years.  My list of Scummbags of the intnet because hey, despite yeaars of warning people they still don't believe me.

So how bad is it kids?   Let's start.

Remember all of this was captured over about an hour of one phone sitting otherwise idle.  

Phone is running a "firewall", configured to block everything.   Clearly not working.  

Phone is _not_ associated with any vendors services (no Google account, no Samsung, nor any carrier).  Besides the firewall any application that can be, has been disabled / removed (facebook for example).  No AUP or TOS has _EVER_ been accepted.   This is important to note because all of this activity is unwarented, unsolicited and certainly behind the users back.

It's being opbserved while connected to an isolated network, though some things do resolve to IPs, there is no external access.   Reason being Google, for all their R&D, is one of the chattiest steaming piles of poop I've ever seen.  If you're not on a network it will CONSTANTLY try contacting connectivitycheck.android.com -- about every 15 seconds.

###### Fun fact and something Cell carriers learned a long, long time ago - constantly roaming wastes batteries.  Guess no one told Google that, maybe they shouldn't have fired Motorola RF engineers.
