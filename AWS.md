AWS - Amazon Web Services
-------------------------

In response to January 6th in Washinton, DC., AWS along with Google, Mozila, Facebook, Twitch, Twitter and many more conspired to remove any and all traces of people they alone deemed to be Terrorists.  That included competing sites like Parler which was wiped not only offline but had their entire server infrastructure pulled from AWS, by Amazon.   It's important to docoment this was not at the request of any judicial body.  It was Tech companies alone, and continue to do so as of this update.

This is my documented fuck you to them.
