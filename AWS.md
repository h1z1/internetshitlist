AWS - Amazon Web Services
-------------------------

In response to January 6th in Washinton, DC., AWS along with Google, Mozila, Facebook, Twitch, Twitter and many more conspired to remove any and all traces of people they alone deemed to be Terrorists.  That included competing sites like Parler which was wiped not only offline but had their entire server infrastructure pulled from AWS, by Amazon.   It's important to docoment this was not at the request of any judicial body.  It was Tech companies alone, and continue to do so as of this update.

This is my documented fuck you to them.

Your data is not safe on these platforms.


Outages
-------
On or about December 9th, 2021 AWS started experiencing "outages" with varying scopes of impact.  While many media (laugh), refer to it as one event, the issues persisted over several days and did not affect all users in any particular region.   In many ways it feels like a test we'd do in datacenters to find points of failure - literally turning gear off to see what fails... or perhaps in their case find where "trouble users" are running.  Parts of Infowars, Bitchute, locals, etc were down for example but while slow, Rumble was not (Rumble uses Akamai).  AWS's own dashboards and consoles were at one point down.

Notable affected "users" listed were Disney, Tinder, Amazon Services like Ring, Alexa, etc.   The real impact howeer and perhaps more damning is users whom unbeknowningly have services on AWS.  That included public safety, doctors offices, cdns, etc.

What remains bizaare about this outages is the lack of coverage from people whom would know, mainly NANOG.  They've been silent.

Was it intentional?  It was not their first _massive_ outage nor will it be their last.  Quesiton remains how long people will continue putting up with their data being stored on cloud providers.  Especialyl as Governments around the world continue putting their citizens data on it (US Millitary / DOD is a major customer of AWS for example).
