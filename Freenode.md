Freenode **should not be used for really anything**. 

Do not confuse Freenode with other networks nor IRC itself.  EFNet for example.


CLOAKS
------
Freenode "Cloaks", are not the same as spoofing on other networks. General operators and apaprently end users are able to reveal the IP behind any cloak. Freenode does not see a problem with this. 

More daming is the aparent policy of staff to kill split servers even though they may have users whom are connected without issue.   Reconnecting requires reauthenticating with NICKSERV before a cloak is reapplied.


STAFF
-----
Deny, deny, deny ... Staff are largely unhelpful, outright arrogant especially when it comes to security and operational issues.  See discussions with staff.


CHANNELS
--------
Unlike other networks, Freenode allows channel registration which leads to lovely cases where channels are squated or more hillariously, reserved by Freenode themselves.



USERS NAMES
------------
Unlike other networks, Freenode allows nick registration which leads to lovely cases where nicks are squated or more hillariously, reserved by Freenode themselves.


CODE/SERVERS
------------

Code cannot be vetted as it's closed to Freenode Inc.

Freenode is a commercial organization which maintains every server, as such no process be it code or security can be vetted.


INTERCEPTION
------------

Under the guise of spam control, Freenode added the ability for every message, public or private, to be intercepted and scanned for "malicious intent".  They claim this is not possible to reverse and used for general logging as it's based on hashing..  That not only makes no sense but further indicates how clueless this organization is wrt security or privacy.


SERVER LOCATIONS
----------------

It is not possible as an end user to list what servers are connected, nor where they are located.  This is especially concerning with hubs as they become central points of interception -legal or otherwise.


CERTIFICATE USE
---------------

Server SSL certifcates have several times changed with no notice nor warning to users.  They were not expired but regenerated entirely.



HOST NAMES
---------

irc.freenode.net is an alias for chat.freenode.net.

No where near the servers connected

-!- There are 97 users and 83728 invisible on 30 servers
