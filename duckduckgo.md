Duckduckgo
==========


While frequently cited as thee search engine alternative for privacy, it's worth noting there are some bizzare things about ddg.

First, it relies on other search engines much like the old metacrawler.  You'll sometimes see those timeout / throw errors in the results (Google and Bing for example do quite often)

Known major backends include Yandex, Bing, Google and Yahoo.

DDG itself is hosted on Azure -- aka Microsoft.  They even use Outlook.com for fucking email.

Duckduckgo.com was registered through GoDaddy, a company notorious for being anti-privacy (especially wrt SSL certificates).

Their DNS is also hosted by yet another third party - "NS1".  A company focused more on profit and analytics than anything remotely privacy related.

Among their "Executive" team:
   ```
   Prior to joining NS1, Lorraine led People functions at Yotpo and
   AppNexus, and reaching back in her career, she held HR Relationship
   Leader roles at BlackRock, American Express and Citi.
   ```
   
   Blackrock can shove a coal up their arse.  Much of their entire executive is comprised of the same.  Again, not people even remotely interested in privacy.
