biggest acquisitions. Prosus invests globally across a range of online 
platforms focused on areas such as food delivery, classifieds and 
fintech. It also maintains a more than $200 billion holding in Tencent.

Stackoverflow management is _Very_ poltiical in nature.  They have come out in "support" of terrorist groups like BLM.  

Their CEO changed in 2020 and one of the first thigns he did was create a "moderator council"

Between taking credit for literally years of public labour, this is all cookie cutter SOP for how International companies are gutted and their IP stolen.


tl;DR - Avoid overflow sites.
